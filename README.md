# AntiMath
## Project Description
AntyMath is a web app to resolve exercises of integral calculus, the project emerged by my friend, who has the idea to create the app, we both didn't do very well in integral calculus, and he thinks we can create an app to do it for us.

I used flask and Numpy, I choose Flask because is lightweight and a don't need something more complete like Django, Flask meets all we needed at the time. Numpy is the perfect option to work with numbers in python, and have some functions we are going to need, in other words, a little less work.

The project requirements to run will be added as the project grows.
